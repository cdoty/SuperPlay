Super Play
=========

The Super Play Game Engine (Super Play) contains a modern implementation of many SNES features.

Super Play is written in C++, and supports OpenGL ES 1.1 and DirectX 9, and
BASS, Hekkus, and irrKlang sound engines. Super Play also contains tools to import game 
resources from Tiled, Mappy, Aseprite, Nanimstudio, ProMotion, PyxelEdit, Pickle Editor,
and Bitmap Font Editor.

Currently Super Play supports Windows, Linux, Android/GameStick/Ouya, iOS, Raspberry Pi, and Marmalade.
Work is in progress for Emscripten, Windows Phone, and Mac OSX.
